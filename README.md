## Overview
This project proposes a mobile application for secure and convenient money‬ transfers, incorporating features similar to online banking and mobile money apps.‬ 

The app's features align with predefined user stories and integrate seamlessly with the backend. The complete list of user stories can be found in the PDF located in the ``develop`` branch named ``BM 2024 Project - Money Transfer Application.pdf``.

Our final work is included in the ``develop branch``

## Architecture 
Speedo Transfer project is implemented using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture pattern.
- ___Model:___ Contains the data and any business logic required to handle that data.
- ___View:___ is responsible for displaying the UI design to the user.
- ___Controller:___ handles any user input or interactions and update the Model and View as needed.

## Structure

    Registration/
    ├── Shared          # Files that are shared across multiple parts of the project.
    ├── Manager         # Files manages API, tokens and userDefaults implying Singleton Pattern.
    ├── Utils           # Constant file and common helper functions to reuse.
    ├── Extension       # Common functions added as an extension for existing UI Components.
    └── Resources       # Non-code files such as images, colors, fonts and other types of assets. 

- ___Manager:___ 
    - API manager 
        - Handles APIs in multiple ways using native URL sessions and external Alamofire pod

        - Checks if user is logged in or out
    - Keychain manager
        - Securely save and retrieve the token used in the APIs
    - Token manager
        - Calls the keychain functions to get and set the token 
- ___Extensions:___ Common functionality added to ``UIViewController`` and ``UIView`` through extensions.
